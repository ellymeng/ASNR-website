# Animal-Social-Structure-Network-Repository
This website displays a repository of over five-hundred and thirty-five 
social network datasets from forty-six different species. These publicly-available datasets were accumulated by 
a team at the Bansal Lab, a computational biology lab at Georgetown University.
This repository is novel in that 
it incorporates different animal networks that vary in sociality levels, including social, 
solitary and fission fusion. It synthesizes all of these networks in an organized, consistent 
manner in order to make sure that the networks are user-friendly and aid researchers in advancing 
the field of wildlife network theory. Due to its extensive and detailed nature, the networks found 
in this repository can be used to answer multiple scientific inquiries in varying fields.

The website is implemented in HTML, CSS and Javascript, and utilizes the "modern business" Bootstrap library.
